# ChatGPT_DALL-E2_cli

A simple Python tool to interact with the openai API to quickly generate images.
You have to replace your API key with the placeholder (api_key = input("Input your API-KEY: ").

Make sure you have the requests lib installed. 
If not: 
```
$ python -m pip install requests
```
To run the script just hit:
```
$ python3 chatgpt_dall-e2_cli.py
```
Now you can enter your desired prompt and become a AI artist. (not really)
